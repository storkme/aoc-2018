My solutions to 2018's [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) event.

Solutions are in javascript. Run using Node.js (>= v10) with the `--experimental-modules` flag.

## Running

```
node --experimental-modules day1 inputs/1.txt
```  

Typically each `index.mjs` file will have two functions, a `part1()` and a `part2()`, which will produce the answer for each part.
